# MyToken Project

## Overview
The MyToken project is a simple smart contract implementation on the Ethereum blockchain. This project demonstrates the basic functionality of a token contract, including minting and burning tokens.

## Description
The MyToken smart contract is designed to manage a basic cryptocurrency token named "META" with the abbreviation "MTA". This contract allows for the creation of new tokens (minting) and the destruction of existing tokens (burning). The total supply of tokens and individual balances are tracked using public variables and mappings.
